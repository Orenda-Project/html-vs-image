// VENDORED from the NIETE (ICT) bot, niete/bot/vendor/lp-v9/lib/migrate.js — upstream is the
// curriculum-baked-lesson-plans skill. Copied verbatim so an lp_doc is lifted to 3.0 exactly the
// way ICT's own renderer lifts it; re-vendor rather than edit. See lp-render/guide/from-lpdoc.js.

// lp_doc 2.0 -> the 3.0 SHAPE, in memory, for the renderer.
//
// The v9 template renders exactly one shape. Rather than carry two layout code paths (which
// is how a "fix" lands in one and not the other), a 2.0 document is lifted into the 3.0 shape
// on the way into the renderer. This is a RENDER-TIME normalisation, never a rewrite of the
// artefact of record: the file on disk stays 2.0 and keeps being validated as 2.0.
//
// What the lift does, and why each is a lift and not a guess:
//   • objectives  [string]         -> { outcome, by_the_end, items:[{text, slo_code:null}] }
//                                     outcome = the first objective, which is what a 2.0 doc
//                                     put there by convention; by_the_end = slo.success_criterion.
//   • warmup      top-level        -> sections[introduction].warmup, minutes folded INTO the
//                                     introduction's own badge (spec §2: the warm-up is one row
//                                     inside the Introduction, not a section).
//   • say blocks                   -> paragraph blocks. Spec §8 bans the scripted box; the
//                                     WORDS are still the author's and are not thrown away.
//   • homework section             -> a plain section. A 2.0 doc has no tagged homework items,
//                                     so nothing is invented: the v9 homework table only prints
//                                     when the data is there.
// Everything else passes through untouched.
